{"purpose":[{"description":"Your code implements the key tasks: loads datasets, extracts Vein and Artery lifespans, computes means, performs one-sample and two-sample t-tests, and analyzes the iron data with a contingency table and chi-square test. It aligns with the project goals and runs without syntax errors.","old_code":"","new_code":""},{"description":"Explicitly prints the initial Lifespans data to verify structure and ensures Task 1 is visibly completed.","old_code":"","new_code":""}],"readability":[{"description":"Code uses clear section headers and straightforward variable names, making it easy to follow the flow of tasks.","old_code":"","new_code":""},{"description":"Some lines are slightly terse; adding minimal comments above key steps (e.g., why we test against 73) could improve readability.","old_code":"","new_code":""}],"performance":[{"description":"The code uses vectorized pandas filtering and NumPy means efficiently for lifespans data.","old_code":"","new_code":""},{"description":"Consider caching repeated lookups (e.g., vein_pack_lifespans) is already done; ensure the contingency table creation is only computed once. Also ensure the imported test functions are used consistently for each task to avoid overwriting p-values.","old_code":"","new_code":""}]}
